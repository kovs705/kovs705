### Hi everyone

My name is Eugene, I'm 20 y.o. Swift developer. Love learning foreign languages, coding apps that I want to use daily, and spend my spare time playing on musical instruments

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m working on:**
 - [BlockNote App](https://github.com/kovs705/BlockNote-app) - notemaking app for those who study, work, tracks something or like to keep everything not only _on phone_, but _also on paper_ (50% done)
 - [My Progress](https://github.com/kovs705/My-progress) - pet-project app with countdown feature (70-80% done)
 - [WhatsNew app](https://github.com/kovs705/Whats-New) - pet-project, clone of SwiftNew package in GitHub. Requires some visual bog fixing and making it as a package, not an app. (99% done, needs documentation and simple customization)
 - [JapHelper](https://github.com/kovs705/JapHelper) - an app to learn Japanese with grammatic pages, divided by **JLPT** levels, ability to see the progress and make notes (paused)
 - [ARDoc](https://github.com/kovs705/ARdoc) - (soon)
 
 ðŸ“š**Languages:**
 1. Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, programmatic UI, Storyboard/xib
 2. Objective-C (started learning)
 2. Java (used to code apps in Android Studio)

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m learning:**
- **App Development with Swift and SwiftUI**
- **Japanese language**
- **Guitar, bass and piano playing**
- **Hacking with iOS: UIKit Edition**
