### Hi everyone

My name is Eugene, I'm 20 y.o. Swift developer. Love learning foreign languages, coding apps that I want to use daily, and spend my spare time playing on musical instruments

🔭 **I’m working on:**
 - [BlockNote App](https://github.com/kovs705/BlockNote-app) - notemaking app for those who study, work, tracks something or like to keep everything not only _on phone_, but _also on paper_ (50% done)
 - [JMDictionary](https://github.com/kovs705/JMDictionary) - using **JMDict** (the property of the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group) you can search the Japanese word and soon you could save favorites and edit details (25% done)
 - [My Progress](https://github.com/kovs705/My-progress) - pet-project app with countdown feature (70-80% done)
 - [WhatsNew package](https://github.com/kovs705/WhatsNewPack) - pet-project package with the view of new features of your app (99% done, needs documentation, little fixes)
 
 📚**Languages:**
 1. Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI
 2. Objective-C (reading)
 2. Java (used to code apps in Android Studio)
 3. Foreign languges: Japanese, Finnish and English
