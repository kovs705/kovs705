### Hi everyone

My name is Eugene, I'm Swift developer. Love learning foreign languages, coding apps that I want to use daily and spend my spare time playing on musical instruments

🔥 **I’m currently working on:**
 - 💊 2 private projects, UIKit and SwiftUI
 - 🌿 [Ambience](https://github.com/kovs705/Ambience) - UIKit pet-project app with relaxing sounds of nature in you pocket, uses [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)
 - 📓 [BlockNote](https://github.com/kovs705/BlockNote-app) - notemaking app for those who study, work or tracks something
 - 📚 [JMDictionary](https://github.com/kovs705/JMDictionary) - SwiftUI pet-project app, using **JMDict** (the property of the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group) to search Japanese words with saving to favorites and editing details
 


🙋‍♂️ **My other projects:**
 - 🗞 [News App](https://github.com/kovs705/NewsToDay) - read news by your preferences, add in favorites or share with others
